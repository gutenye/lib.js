## üåü Design Goals

This is NOT a library. It's a collection of re-usable code that you can copy and paste into your apps. You do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.
Pick the code you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

- Drop-in replacement
- Copy & paste only, do not publish the package.
- Naming: Can use same name if it's a drop-in replacement, otherwsie use a different name
